PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
NarraMaker is a collaborative story writing website that is free for all users. By making an account, you can read and write stories and add to othersâ€™. These stories are categorized by genre and accessible to other users on the Browse page. NarraMaker will track contributions by users and allow users to work together to craft narratives in an open, updated, and easy-to-understand environment.

<br> 
Install Guide: 
In order to gain access to the final website, this repository must be git cloned. With emphasis on the app.py file, pre-existing SQLite3 + python3 + Flask app (pip install & with your created environment activated) on your laptop, the project should produce a NarraMaker (a collection of stories that have been uploaded by us and others).
