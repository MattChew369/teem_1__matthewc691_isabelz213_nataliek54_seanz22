today we had our documents reviewed, many comments were made and many comments have been taken.
new design pdf if being created due to changed objective.
old design doc comments are being used to edit new

INITIAL DD REVIEW
new knowledge being applied like lists cannot go in SQLs
organizing tangled component map
need to add dates to timeline
variables changing to be casual case
would benefit from listing specific pages on site map
provide explicit examples
"bland design" "unprofessional" on our google slide design mark up, so mean
will expand on CSS once further into process

train is chugging smoothly

PIVOT design documents reviewd
PART 2 DD REVIEW thank you DECK and bigpro

task timeline
- dates is WAY off, align to new target ship date 11/10/2025
- add people to roles in gaernal task timeline

program components ~ list
- explain Static : comment saying "do you mean static files?"
- people don't understand the process oh no!
  needs more explaination, need more to how each component relates to eachother

program components ~ tables
- text, not strings cause squlite3 doesn't have string datatype (the more you know)
- "starting author" might not be neccesary as it's jsut the 1st contributor
- usernames in contributions hsould be FK, referencing the other table (users)
- page_edited is FK, page_edit is essentially referencing title from stories

maps
- in site maps, rename the cells to the htmls, update it to the new one
- in component maps, map needs to be more "cyclical", show the cycle
- create browse.html

other concerns & questions
- is there a plan is someone creates a story with the same title as another? (probably create smt to check that)

compliments! --
- they like the mockups! hooray!
- they like the clarifications on the site map! yay!
- they think dates of the contributiosn is a good idea! hoorah!
- they like our Today's task list!

God I'm so tired. Hands in team! 1, 2, 3! Teem_1!
